"""(Experimental) replacement for import/export functionality.

This module contains the `Document` class, a container for a DOM-style 
document (e.g. svg, html, xml, etc.) designed to replace and improve 
upon the IO functionality of svgpathtools (i.e. the svg2paths and 
disvg/wsvg functions). 

An Historic Note:
     The functionality in this module is meant to replace and improve 
     upon the IO functionality previously provided by the the 
     `svg2paths` and `disvg`/`wsvg` functions. 

Example:
    Typical usage looks something like the following.

        >> from svgpathtools import *
        >> doc = Document('my_file.html')
        >> results = doc.flatten_all_paths()
        >> for result in results:
        >>     path = result.path
        >>     # Do something with the transformed Path object.
        >>     element = result.element
        >>     # Inspect the raw SVG element. This gives access to the
        >>     # path's attributes
        >>     transform = result.transform
        >>     # Use the transform that was applied to the path.
        >> foo(doc.tree)  # do stuff using ElementTree's functionality
        >> doc.display()  # display doc in OS's default application
        >> doc.save('my_new_file.html')

A Big Problem:  
    Derivatives and other functions may be messed up by 
    transforms unless transforms are flattened (and not included in 
    css)
