    "\n",
    "svgpathtools is a collection of tools for manipulating and analyzing SVG Path objects and Bézier curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "svgpathtools contains functions designed to **easily read, write and display SVG files** as well as *a large selection of geometrically\\-oriented tools* to **transform and analyze path elements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the submodule *bezier.py* contains tools for for working with general **nth order Bezier curves stored as n-tuples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some included tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **read**, **write**, and **display** SVG files containing Path (and other) SVG elements\n",
    "- convert Bézier path segments to **numpy.poly1d** (polynomial) objects\n",
    "- convert polynomials (in standard form) to their Bézier form\n",
    "- compute **tangent vectors** and (right-hand rule) **normal vectors**\n",
    "- compute **curvature**\n",
    "- break discontinuous paths into their **continuous subpaths**.\n",
    "- efficiently compute **intersections** between paths and/or segments\n",
    "- find a **bounding box** for a path or segment\n",
    "- **reverse** segment/path orientation\n",
    "- **crop** and **split** paths and segments\n",
    "- **smooth** paths (i.e. smooth away kinks to make paths differentiable)\n",
    "- **transition maps** from path domain to segment domain and back (T2t and t2T)\n",
    "- compute **area** enclosed by a closed path\n",
    "- compute **arc length**\n",
    "- compute **inverse arc length**\n",
    "- convert RGB color tuples to hexadecimal color strings and back\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- **numpy**\n",
    "- **svgwrite**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If not already installed, you can **install the prerequisites** using  pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install svgwrite\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then **install svgpathtools**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install svgpathtools\n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Alternative Setup \n",
    "You can download the source from Github and install by using the command (from inside the folder containing setup.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credit where credit's due\n",
    "Much of the core of this module was taken from [the svg.path (v2.0) module](https://github.com/regebro/svg.path).  Interested svg.path users should see the compatibility notes at bottom of this readme.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "The svgpathtools module is primarily structured around four path segment classes: ``Line``, ``QuadraticBezier``, ``CubicBezier``, and ``Arc``.  There is also a fifth class, ``Path``, whose objects are sequences of (connected or disconnected<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup>) path segment objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``Line(start, end)``\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``Arc(start, radius, rotation, large_arc, sweep, end)``  Note: See docstring for a detailed explanation of these parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``QuadraticBezier(start, control, end)``\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``CubicBezier(start, control1, control2, end)``\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``Path(*segments)``\n",
    "\n",
    "See the relevant docstrings in *path.py* or the [official SVG specifications](<http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html>) for more information on what each parameter means.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u id=\"f1\">1</u> Warning:  Some of the functionality in this library has not been tested on discontinuous Path objects.  A simple workaround is provided, however, by the ``Path.continuous_subpaths()`` method.    [↩](#a1)"
